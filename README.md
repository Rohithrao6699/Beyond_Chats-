## 📁 Project Structure & Conventions

### Folder Structure & Separation of Concerns

- `ui/` – Reusable UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)  
- `components/` – Core app components (Navbar, Sidebar, etc.)  
- `services/` – API call logic  
- `mockData/` – Static/mock data  
- `assets/` – Custom Icons and images  
- `types/` – TypeScript type definitions  
- `hooks/` – Custom React hooks  
- `store/` – Zustand state management  

### App Architecture

- `App.tsx` contains:  
  - `<Navbar />` – Top navigation  
  - `<Content />` – Main layout section  

- `Content.tsx` includes:  
  - `LsideBar`  
  - `Main`  
  - `RsideBar`  

Each component:  
- Contains its own handler functions  
- Uses reusable UI components  
- Shares global state through Zustand
